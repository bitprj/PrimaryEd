## Research 
* Important to remember: “learning disabled students are not students who are unable to learn but need differentiated instruction tailored to their distinctive learning abilities”
* Tips to know!
  - Not all disabilities are visible 
  - People can have temporary disabilities 
  - Do not ask personal questions unless they want to discuss it. Only refer to it when it is relevant
  - Be friendly and patient 
  - Do not refer to them as the “disabled student” because it doesn’t place importance on the fact that they are a student. It is better to say “the student, who has a disability”. 
  - Do not be bias and treat each student as an individual 
* Types of disabilities 
  - Hearing loss, low vision or blindness, learning disabilities (ADHD, dyslexia, or dyscalculia), mobility disabilities, chronic health disorders (epilepsy, Crohn’s disease, arthritis, cancer, diabetes, migraines, multiple sclerosis), psychological or psychiatric disabilities (mood anxiety, depressive disorders, PTSD), asperger’s disorder and Autism spectrum disorders, traumatic brain injury 
* Strategies for volunteers
  - Be patient 
  - Provide oral instruction 
  - Let students know how well they are progressing toward an individual or class goal
  - Give immediate feedback to learning disabled students. They need to see the relationship between what was taught and what was learned 
  - Learning disabled students have difficulty learning abstract terms and concepts. You can show them objects that they can touch, hear, smell, etc. 
  - Give the students a lot of specific phrases that link the activity with the recognition 
  - When necessary, repeat instructions or offer information. 
  - Provide extra time for reading and writing activities 
* Hearing impairment Students
  - Provide written or pictorial directions
  - Physically act out the steps for an activity 
  - Set the hearing impaired child in front of the classroom
  - Enunciate your words (but don’t overdo it) and look directly at the student 
  - Provide a multisensory experience for students 
  - Be patient 
  - Demonstrate what you are saying by using touchable items
  - Can use models, diagrams, samples,
* Emotional support
  - Put them in charge of the activity = give them a sense of responsibility 
  - Guide them along the activity but don’t tell them what to do directly
  - Get the student involved with other students so they can interact
  - Discuss appropriate classroom behavior 
  - Seat them away from any distractions if possible (highly verbal students, equipment, tools, etc.) 
  - Provide immediate feedback, reinforcement, and a sufficient amount of praise
* ADHD
  - Make instructions brief and clear 
  - Make sure behavioral expectations are clear
  - Make frequent eye contact 
  - Combine both visual and auditory information when giving directions 
* Dyslexia
  - Visual and Verbal Instructions
  - Using Color and Underlines to emphasize key points.
  - Provide extra time for reading and writing
  - Pairing students with a partner during work time.
  - Breaking down tasks into small easily remembered pieces of information.
  - Let students sit at the front of the classroom. 
* Dyscalculia
  - Severe difficulty in making arithmetical calculations, as a result of brain disorder.
  - Use graph paper. It helps keep columns and numbers straight and neat.
  - Having easy-to-use calculators and plenty of erasers on hand.
